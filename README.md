# LlamaSweeper

This is my minesweeper website. It has a bunch of features that don't exist anywhere else. It has different minesweeper variants that target certain skills. It also has a cutting-edge zini calculator which can be used to calculate the minimum number of clicks a game can be solved in. I've tried to make it perform well on mobile as well as desktop.
