Just some random things I need to do

Improve OthersPage to use masonary layout instead of grid
Move project files over to WSL2 (this is needed for hot-reload to work?)

stuff for play page:
first click always opening? (or do NG x?)
make stats work for lost games as well
implement zini alg
add replays
add proper border around board (and mine counter/timer?)

Change revealedNumbers stuff to be tiles[x][y] and then hide behind getters/setters. Like setTileState(x, y, newState) and setTileDepressed(x, y, true)

Look at mouseEvent.buttons to check whether the left button is depressed when hovering (fixes issues with left click down outside the window etc)
