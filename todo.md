Just some random things I need to do

Improve OthersPage to use masonary layout instead of grid

Make separate component for variants (cards on Others page)

Move project files over to WSL2 (this is needed for hot-reload to work?)

data entry for variants. The below is remaining, also need to create images. /img/variants/.png

mobile:
msgo, mastermine, LoM, chocolatesweeper
tool:
qqwref prob calc, mscoach solver, ptta zini calc, mzrg make_board
