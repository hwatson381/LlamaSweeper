Just some random things I need to do

Improve OthersPage to use masonary layout instead of grid
Move project files over to WSL2 (this is needed for hot-reload to work?)

stuff for play page:
first click always opening? (or do NG x?)
make stats work for lost games as well
implement zini alg
add replays
add hoveredSquare getting depressed if mouseDown pressed
